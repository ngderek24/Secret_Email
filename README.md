# Secret_Email

SecretEmail is an application built with Eclipse Window Builder that allows the user to send an encrypted email message to another person. The user can also decrypt the encrypted message and attach files along with the email. This project was done during Summer 2015 by myself to get more experience with Eclipse, Java, and Window Builder.
